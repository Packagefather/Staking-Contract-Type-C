# Staking-Contract-Type-C

This is a staking contract where users can stake more than one kind of token in a single pool, but the pool is able to recognise each as a sub pool, more like having many independent pools for each LP or desired token, but in this, all are staked in a single pool but properly recognised as different sub-pools.
